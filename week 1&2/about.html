        <h1> Learn About Swimming</h1>
        <h3> What is Swimming?</h3>
        <p> Swimming is the biggest water sport. It is comprised of swimming the four strokes: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle. You swim in either a 25 meter pool or a 25 yard pool. Most pools are 25 yards but in the Olympics you swim in a 50 meter pool. There are also certain seasons in swim. There is a short course season which spans from fall through spring where you only swim yards. Then, there is the long course season which is during the summer where you only swim in meters.</p> 
        <p> In swimming, lengths of the pool are called after the lengths and go by increments of 25. For example if you are going to swim one lap you would say "I'm going to swim a 25." Two laps would be a 50, 3 would be a 75 and so on. There are also several races you can swim for each of the stokes. The races are by length so, there is a 100m race for all of the strokes and a 200m race for all of the stokes. Freestyle is special and also has a 50m race, a 400m race, and a 1650m race which is a mile. </p>

        <p> Swim meets will occur every couple of weeks. At those meets, you will race in you or your coahces choice of events. You will race against other teams for the fastest times.
